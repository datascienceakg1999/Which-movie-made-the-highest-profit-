To identify the movie with the highest profit, along with its producer, director, and actors, I would need access to a database or dataset that includes information about movies, their production costs, box office earnings, and associated personnel.

Do you have a specific dataset or source from which you would like to extract this information, or are you looking for general information about the highest-grossing movie in history? If it's the latter, as of my last update in 2023, the highest-grossing movie is "Avatar" (2009), directed by James Cameron. However, the highest profit might require adjusting for production and marketing costs, which isn't as straightforward.

Here is a more detailed breakdown for "Avatar":

Director: James Cameron
Producers: James Cameron and Jon Landau
Main Actors: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez
If you have a specific dataset or movie in mind, please provide more details!
